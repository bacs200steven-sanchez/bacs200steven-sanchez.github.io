            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Dragon Sweeper is a fresh take on a classic game from the 90s: Minesweeper. In Minesweeper, the goal of the game was to safely mark all mines on a grid by process of elimination. In Dragon Sweeper, the goal of the game is to find enough treasure to make you strong enough to face the dragon at the center of the map. However, there is much more to worry about than mines along the way: monsters and traps that guard the treasure you need to get stronger. Through a cycle of sacrificing health points for treasure that eventually allows you to heal and get stronger than before, you slowly gain the strength you need to eventually overcome the dragon!</p>

            <h2>How To Play</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The safest move to start is to click on the <img src="images/crystalball.png" alt="crystal ball">, which will reveal a small area of the map for you.</li>
                <li>Check how many hearts you have (5 to start), and click on a revealed enemy with a power level equal to or less than that.
                    <section class="side">
                        <h3>Sidenote</h3>
                        <p>You might notice other spaces that don't display a power level, such as <img src="images/wall.png" alt="wall"> or <img src="images/scrollheart.png" alt="heart scroll">. <strong>Ignore them for now.</strong></p>
                    </section>
                </li>
                <li>Upon defeat, most enemies simply drop treasure in an amount equal to their power level. Click again on the square to pick up the treasure, which you will see is stored in a gauge below your heart bar at the bottom of the screen.</li>
                <li>Repeat steps 2 and 3 as many times as possible. You should now have enough treasure to level up! Click on the <img src="images/levelup.png" alt="level up"> icon and observe that 2 important things happen:
                    <ul>
                        <li>All of your heart points are refilled</li>
                        <li>You progress toward growing a new heart</li>
                    </ul>
                    <section class="side">
                        <h3>Sidenote</h3>
                        <p>For peak efficiency, try to <strong>never level up unless your hearts are completely depleted</strong>. If you ever can't find a monster to spend your hearts on without dying, use them toward breaking a <img src="images/wall.png" alt="wall">. They take 3 hits before the crumble, revealing a single treasure. Better than nothing!</p>
                    </section>
                    
                </li>
                <li>Repeat step 4 until you run out of revealed monsters or you don't have enough treasure to level up.
                    <br><br>
                    In this situation, you basically have 2 options:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Use a revealed <img src="images/scrollheart.png" alt="heart scroll"> to replenish your health (sort of like leveling up, but without progressing toward a new heart)</li>
                        <li>Venture into the unknown by clicking on an unrevealed space.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>But wait! This is the step that can get you killed!</strong> You'll want to make an educated guess on what space would be safest before you dive in.
                            <br><br>
                            In order guess what monsters or treasure await in each unexplored space, we can look at the numbers shown in any surrounding blank spaces. This number is the total power level of threats surrounding that blank space. Take the example below:
                            <br><br>
                            <img id="example1" src="images/example1.png" alt="Example 1">
                            <br><br>
                            Notice how one of our blank spaces is displaying "1". This means of the 3 unrevealed spaces surrounding that space (including diagonals), the sum of their threat levels is only 1. If we only had 1 heart left at this point, we could confidently click on any of those 3 spaces and know that the worst that could happen is we end up spending our last heart fighting a <img src="images/rat.png" alt="rat">. One of the best things that could happen is we find a treasure chest! In fact, we know we can click on all 3 spaces with no risk of death.
                            <br><br>
                            Now let's look at the "9" space. 9 seems pretty scary if we're only sitting at 1 heart. But notice that this "9" is taking into account the <img src="images/skeleton.png" alt="3"> and <img src="images/demon.png" alt="4"> that were already revealed by the crystal ball at the start. That means that of the 2 remaining unexplored spaces around the "9", the sum of their threat levels is 2. In other words, if we were to click on one of those spacecs, it's guaranteed to have a threat level of either 0, 1, or 2. 2 would kill us, but 0 or 1 could lead us to more treasure!
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Continue repeating the previous steps until you either run out of luck or eventually level up enough to fight the dragon with 13 hearts!</li>
            </ol>
